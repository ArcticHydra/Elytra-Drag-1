A fork of the [Elytra Drag](https://modrinth.com/mod/elytra-drag) mod by bl4st. I made this fork because the mod updates slowly and I also wanted to add some features to it.

- You can slow down (apply drag) by pressing the Shift key. This also stops any currently used firework rocket.
- If you are slowing down your fall damage will be capped at a configurable amount.
- The wing animation is changed when applying drag.

The mod is server-side only, but it can be installed on the client for the wing animation.
